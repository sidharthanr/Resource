```

**1. Basic dplyr functions**
```{r,echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(dplyr)

filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1) # filter by month and day
filter(flights, month == 1 | month == 2) # using and in filter
slice(flights, 1:10) # To select rows by position

arrange(flights, year, month, day) # Arrange rows in a order provided by the columns
arrange(flights, desc(arr_delay)) # Use desc() to order a column in descending order:

select(flights, year, month, day) # Select columns by name
select(flights, year:day) # Select all columns between year and day (inclusive)
select(flights, -(year:day)) # Select all columns except those from year to day (inclusive)
select(flights, tail_num = tailnum) # You can rename variables with select() by using named arguments:

rename(flights, tail_num = tailnum) #select() drops vars not mentioned, Instead, use rename()

distinct(flights, tailnum) # Use distinct()to find unique values in a table:

# Add new columns with mutate()
mutate(flights,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60)
# mutate allows you to refer to columns that you have just created:
# If you only want to keep the new variables, use transmute():

#Summarise values with summarise()
summarise(flights,
  delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

#Randomly sample rows with sample_n() and sample_frac()
sample_n(flights, 10) # for a fixed number
sample_frac(flights, 0.01) # for a fixed fraction


```

**2. Grouping functions**
```{r,results='hide',echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}

```
**3. Misc**
```{r,results='hide',echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE}
ddply(temp,.(trippurpD,todCat),summarise, wm = weighted.mean(avgDist,nObs)) # Weighted mean using the plyr package function
```
